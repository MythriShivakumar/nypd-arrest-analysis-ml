# NYPD Arrest Data Analysis & Machine Learning

This project presents a comprehensive workflow for analyzing and modeling the NYPD Arrest dataset using both traditional machine learning techniques and neural networks.

## 📊 Project Overview

The notebook walks through the following steps:

- Loading and exploring the NYPD Arrest dataset
- Cleaning the data (missing values, mapping, and outlier removal)
- Encoding categorical features
- Splitting the data and scaling features
- Applying classification models: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting
- Implementing a simple neural network using PyTorch
- Comparing model performance with evaluation metrics

## 🧰 Libraries Used

- `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `torch` (PyTorch)
- `pickle` (for model persistence)

## 📁 Dataset

- `NYPD_Arrest_Data__Year_to_Date_.csv` (You need to download this dataset from NYC Open Data)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Log Loss
- Classification Report

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn torch
